ZFL v2 end to end, with no browser in the way.

The studio is the point of this work, but a language that can only be
exercised through a web page is a language nobody can test. Everything the
form will do — validate a cell, assemble the sheet, decide which
instruments apply, run them — happens here first, headless and under
assert, so the UI can be a view over something already known to work rather
than the only place it works at all.
