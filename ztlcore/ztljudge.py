ztljudge — a closed, abstract tool over the unchanged ZTL core.

Not the studio (no web, no NL, no service): a self-contained instrument
that lives in the repository, that a fork downloads and runs for itself.
It does not touch the core — it only reads a formula, formalizes it, passes
it through the kernel (`ztl.ev`, `zverify.grade`), and reports what
happened. Deliberately abstract: no a downstream consumer, no certificates, no
institutional apparatus — those are specialised elsewhere, on top of this.

Three operations, and they are STEPWISE, not a batch pipeline. You hand it
one formula and it is checked; you hand it a second and it is checked; you
hand it both and an operator, and they are glued:

    check(text, marking)                 → what happened to this claim
    check(other, marking)                → what happened to that one
    join(text, other, operator, marking) → glue the two by the operator

"Formalize" here means parse a formula written in plain symbols
(~ ∧→&, | ∨, -> →, ^ ⊕, = ↔, parentheses) into the kernel's own form; the
kernel is unchanged and does the judging. A marking says which atoms are
verified (T/F) and which are not (Z, the default) — truth is never granted
on credit, so an unverified atom stays a mark.

Run:  python3 ztljudge.py                 (a worked stepwise session)
      python3 ztljudge.py -i              (interactive: check / join / mark)

    Returns (value, atoms). The greedy register decides — it burns the
    mark and answers now. This one waits: Kleene's tables, where an
    unchecked atom survives negation (~Z is Z, not F) and is ABSORBED by a
    decisive partner (Z & F is F, Z | T is T). That absorption is the
    useful part: it means a hole only keeps the answer pending while it is
    LOAD-BEARING, so the responsible atoms fall out of one evaluation
    instead of n probes.

    The label tracks UNCHECKED atoms only, and it is a SOUND
    OVER-APPROXIMATION of the load-bearing ones. The sound half is now
    PROVED, not merely measured: `lean/Receipt.lean`, `receipt_complete`,
    empty axiom list — for the whole language and every valuation, an
    unverified atom the label omits cannot change the answer. Read the
    other way, an atom that could change it is always on the receipt, so
    a refusal never withholds a verdict for a reason it failed to name.
    (The Lean `labF` is this function, asked of both engines rather than
    argued: `bridge.py`, 609 questions, zero divergences.)

    AND IT COVERS THE VERDICT, not only this column. `pending` is printed
    beside a GREEDY verdict, and `receipt_complete_greedy` proves the
    same guarantee there — an unverified atom off the label cannot move
    `ev` either. That was measured before it was proved and I had
    predicted the opposite: the greedy register is non-monotone, so a
    branch Kleene calls decisive looked like where the receipt would
    leak. It does not, because whenever the lazy register commits the
    greedy one agrees with it (`greedy_agrees_when_decided`), and the
    greedy tables absorb exactly where the label drops a branch.

    THE OVER-APPROXIMATION IS MUCH SMALLER THAN WE SAID (measured
    2026-08-20, `lab/label/`). The earlier figures — 16% of pending cells
    at depth 2, 35% at depth 6 — counted an atom as innocent when no
    change to it ALONE moved the answer. That probe is too weak: this
    corpus's own width measurement shows cells where no single ground
    moves the matter and a pair does. Against the right notion — the
    union of minimal JOINTLY moving sets — the label is EXACT in 93% of
    cells, and never once too small (14,530 cells, zero violations).

    The remaining 7% is a genuine over-approximation and it has one
    cause. `p ∧ (p ∨ q)` with both unverified names `q`, which cannot
    move anything: the analysis reads the two branches independently,
    sees the right one could reach F, and does not notice that it gets
    there only when `p` is F — at which point the left branch has already
    decided the matter. Occurrence-independence again, the same root as
    `¬¬Z = T` and as the lost tautologies.

    AND THE 7% IS ENTIRELY A MULTIPLICITY EFFECT — measured 2026-08-20
    (`lab/label/`: 128,372 linear cells, zero inexact) and then PROVED
    (`lean/LabelExact.lean:label_exact_linear`, zero axioms). On a LINEAR
    claim — every unverified ground mentioned at most once — every atom
    the receipt names is one the answer is genuinely waiting on: there is
    a definite reading of the other unverified grounds under which
    answering this one yes and answering it no give different verdicts.
    All 13-18% of the inexactness sits in cells where some marked atom
    occurs twice, and `clash_names_an_idle_atom` shows the hypothesis is
    load-bearing: `p ∧ ¬p` names `p`, which no reading can move.

    Put beside `Linear.linear_no_loss`, that gives the whole picture for
    linear claims, both halves now machine-checked: **the judge loses no
    truth and names no irrelevant ground.** The only imperfection left
    there is the over-grant, and that one comes from the collapse
    `¬Z = F`, not from multiplicity.

    NOT CLOSABLE BY DEMAND PROPAGATION — tried and measured. A
    demand-driven label over reachable sibling values was built as a
    prototype and matched this one cell for cell: same 93%, not one cell
    narrower. The existing label already IS that analysis. Closing the 7%
    needs relational tracking of shared occurrences across branches,
    which is not cheap.
    The first draft of this docstring claimed "carriers for free in one
    pass", which the measurement refused. (Label propagation of this
    kind is old — de Kleer's ATMS, 1986 — and is named here rather than
    presented as new. A first draft also reported a `justified_by` field
    for decided values; it was always empty, because a label of holes
    cannot say who decided. The field was removed rather than renamed.)"""

      REFUTED   verdict F, hereditary — false regardless of the marks.
      ON CREDIT verdict T, but not hereditary — true only while an unverified

    nothing to judge on that point, and its silence is not an answer in either
    direction. Under one mark for both, the judge issues a verification order
