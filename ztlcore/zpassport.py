Expedition E18: the quarantine passport — kinds of ungroundedness.

Z was blind: the liar and the truth-teller both landed in quarantine
with the same mark. The passport cures the blindness WITHOUT touching
the logic: verdicts stay T/F, the tables and greediness are intact —
the passport is solver-side metadata about the quarantine set, computed
per strongly connected component of the dependency graph:

  GROUNDED         lazy lfp gives a classical value — no passport needed.
  PARADOX          the component has NO classical model consistent with
                   its grounded environment (odd cycles): the refusal is
                   PERMANENT — no act can ever lift it; the greedy
                   oscillation period is recorded (liar 2, carousel 4).
  INTRINSIC        exactly ONE classical model exists (Kripke's intrinsic
                   value): ungrounded, yet uniquely consistent — the
                   stipulation is FORCED, not chosen.
  UNDERDETERMINED  classical models exist (≥ 2): the refusal stands
                   UNTIL STIPULATION — an external choice grounds it.
  INPUT            a plain unverified input imported into the system:
                   the refusal stands until verification (E12).
  DOWNSTREAM       inherited quarantine: the component itself is fine,
                   but it reads quarantined sentences below; culprits
                   are listed — the provenance of refusal (E7 again).

Operational meaning (the stipulation theorem, MEASURED):
UNDERDETERMINED ⟺ stipulating any of its classical models grounds the
component and disturbs nothing already grounded; PARADOX ⟺ every
stipulation contradicts the component's own definitions. The E12 pair
(value, warranty) extends to refusals: quarantine = (Z, passport).

Kripke's taxonomy (grounded/paradoxical/intrinsically ungrounded) and
the revision-theoretic oscillation signatures (Gupta–Belnap), here as
a computable instrument over finite systems.
