znumjudge — the claims-sheet judge: numeric atoms inside core formulas.

Stage 4 of the ZNUM plan (E37). The instrument reads a claims sheet, lets
comparisons over quantities stand INSIDE propositional formulas, supplies
their T/F/Z verdicts from the numeric floor (znum), and has the UNCHANGED
core (ztljudge) judge the formula. Diagnostics merge both floors:

  disposition   EARNED / ON CREDIT / OPEN / REFUTED / E — the last is the
                fourth corner of the reading-set construction: no admissible
                reading exists, so there is nothing to quantify over and no
                verdict to give (a type with no lattice point, units that do
                not unify). It is a VALUE of the floor, not an exception:
                the atom halts, the rest of the sheet is judged. Otherwise:
                core disposition,
                then capped by the numeric provenance axis: NO forced
                verdict rises above ON CREDIT while it rides unearned
                LOAD-BEARING bounds — in either direction, since if truth
                is not taken on credit neither is falsity (a bare number
                is credit, F2). The direction is kept in `polarity`
                ("toward T" / "toward F"), not in a fifth word;
  next_check    one merged list, each entry naming a cure that can
                actually cure (a quantity merely PRESENT in the pedigree
                is no carrier — the probe is widening it to full ignorance
                and seeing whether the verdict survives):
                  measure <quantity>   — interval too wide (numeric Z);
                  document <quantity>  — bounds unearned AND load-bearing;
                  contest type <q>:<t> — the LATTICE is what forces the
                                         verdict; a type is a formalization
                                         commitment, so no witness helps —
                                         the appeal is against the encoding;
                  verify <atom>        — propositional atom still a mark.

Sheet line format (extends ztljudge's ledger format):

    label :: formula :: quantities and marks

    formula     propositional over comparisons and plain atoms:
                sum(a,b) <= c & deadline_ok
                operators: & | ~ -> ^ =  (the core's own), comparisons:
                <= < >= > ==  over +, -, *, /, sum(...), numbers, quantities
                (a divisor whose interval spans 0 makes the atom Z, §25 echo)
    quantities  name=1000 earned:ref | name=[lo,hi] credit | name=? credit
                (=? means no bounds at all: (-inf, inf)); optional type
                token int | decimalK | fracM (multiples of 1/M: thirds,
                eighths — the lattice no decimal one can say) and an
                optional `sample` token (each occurrence of the name is a
                separate act of measurement; without it the name denotes
                ONE THING and repeated occurrences co-refer, so m - m is 0),
                optional unit token read as EXPONENTS (m2, RUB/m2, km/h:
                m·m unifies with m2, m2·RUB/m2 with RUB, m/m with a bare
                number — but km never with m, since a conversion factor is
                a claim about the world, not arithmetic).
                Numbers are read EXACTLY (0.1 is a
                tenth, 8/3 a third of eight): on floats the lattice
                tightening produced FALSE refutations of honest sums.
                Plain atoms keep ztljudge marks: atom=T / atom=F
