Expedition E37: znum — the numeric floor of ZTL (probe).

Design: ZNUM-DESIGN-draft.md (stage 1, curator-accepted forks F1-F3):
  F1  occurrences read DECORRELATED, as in the propositional lift (m-m != 0);
  F2  a bare number is a number ON CREDIT: [x,x] with unearned bounds;
  F3  the two credit axes stay SEPARATE and both are reported:
        interval axis   — is the verdict forced by the current intervals?
        provenance axis — are the bounds themselves earned by witnesses?

The floor is an ATOM SUPPLIER: comparisons over quantities yield T/F/Z
atoms; formulas over those atoms are judged by the UNCHANGED core
(ztljudge) — demonstrated in section 4 below.

The measured bet of this expedition (design §4): interval narrowing is
monotone, therefore on purely numeric atoms a FORCED verdict can never be
revoked by any further narrowing — hereditary in ONE PASS, against the
m-1-deep enumeration the propositional grade costs. Section 3 hunts for a
counterexample over an exhaustive grid, correlated occurrences included.

# system. It is not. It is the fourth corner, and the corpus had already
# stumbled over it twice — as the two ValueErrors below, and as the vacuity
# trap measured in zprove.py, where "all readings are true" comes for free
# when there are no readings to check. Emptiness must be SEPARATED, not
# quantified over.
#
# Note what this answers, since the question came from the ethics thread:
# the norm behind E is not imposed from outside (Augustine had to hang it
# on a Creator). Judging IS quantification over readings; E is what happens
# when there is nothing to quantify over. The judge halts because it has
# nothing to inspect, not because it broke somebody's design.

    The type is a FORMALIZATION commitment, not knowledge: it filters the
    READING SET (readings = lattice(discrete) ∩ [lo, hi]) and needs no
    witness; expire never touches it. `discrete`: None (continuous
    rationals), "int", ("decimal", k) — multiples of 10^-k — or
    ("frac", m) — multiples of 1/m, the lattice a decimal one cannot
    express (thirds, eighths: "she shared it out in thirds" is a sayable
    claim, not a refuted one). `unit`: a name ("candies", "RUB") or None

    construction; if nothing survives, the quantity carries `no_readings`
    and every comparison touching it comes back E — never a vacuous
    verdict, and never an exception either.

    `sample`: what a repeated NAME means. Default False — the quantity is
    ONE THING IN THE WORLD, so every occurrence co-refers and m - m is 0.
    True — each occurrence is a separate ACT of measurement (the same rod
    measured twice), so the occurrences are read independently and
    m - m is not 0. This is a formalization commitment like the type, not
    knowledge: it says what the symbol denotes, needs no witness, and is
