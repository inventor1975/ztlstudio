THE BACKWARD PASS READ OFF THE TABLES — the same answer as `zbackward.backward`,
without listing the sets.

THE CURATOR'S QUESTION (2026-10-09): is the backward pass not the forward pass
read the other way? Measured the same day: one judge call costs 0.04-0.07 ms, so
the backward pass is no longer slow — it is BLIND past size four. It lists the
sets of grounds by size and stops at MAX_K = 4, so a conjunction of six
unverified grounds, whose answer is plainly "check all six", comes back as
"not searched further". Its own definition does not need the listing.

THE IDEA, AND WHY IT IS EXACT. For a set S of grounds, filled in every way (the
other grounds left unverified), each subformula takes a TYPE: the set of pairs
(its value now, the set of values it can take over every refinement of the
grounds still open) over the fillings of S. A connective's type follows from
its children's types by its table — on disjoint atoms the fillings and the
refinements of the two children are independent, so the image is exact. The
disposition is a function of the pair (checked against the judge in the stand):
EARNED  = (T, {T}),  REFUTED = (F, {F}),  ON CREDIT = (T, other),  OPEN = else.

The minimal sets are built bottom-up, per type: if S = S_A + S_B is minimal for
the parent, then S_A is minimal among the sets of A with the same type (a smaller
one would give the same parent type with a smaller S). So the minimal sets of
each type are products of the children's minimal sets, then the minimal ones
among those. No size cap; the work follows the answer's size, not 3^n.

SCOPE OF THIS FIRST TRANCHE, said aloud: an UNVERIFIED ground that occurs twice
breaks the independence. Such a formula is not handled here — `backward_tree`
returns None and the caller keeps `zbackward.backward`. (The forward grade
already handles repeats by enumerating only them, `zverify._values`; the same
can follow here.)
